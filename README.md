# PSGit

A PowerShell implementation of Git, providing a new command-line interface and object pipeline.

The intent is to take full advantage of the object Pipeline and create task-based commands following the verb-noun syntax of PowerShell.  The [[Command Proposals|Command-Proposals]] are a list of the commands we probably need to implement, and how they map to `git` commands.

## Secondary Goals

We're also using this project as a way to test out a process of co-working and doing TDD in PowerShell projects -- we'll have one or two people writing specs and tests and we'll be asking other people to implement the commands to pass the tests.
